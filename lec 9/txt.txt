Ayesha - 3235146

anisha - 456789


iman - 32351



sana - 1223345


This CNIC num will be differet fro everyone

so Ayesha and iman were friend ,ayesha friend was anisha this is id num "45678",this is sana id num "1223345"
none of these four numbers are same 
if i told you any of these id number ,I would have said 32 35 1, you will understand that it is sana 
and if i said 12 23 34 5, you will understand that it is sana  And if i say 45 67 89 And if i say 12 23 34 5 
then you will understand that its about sana 
      "so this identifies uniquely" ->sana,->iman,->anisha,->ayesha. "so this is their id ".
    No one else will get this id .So this is their ID and also 
    

Ayesha - "3235146" -> Class 10th

anisha - "456789"    -> Class 9th


iman - "32351"   -> Class 10th 



sana - "1223345" -> Class 9th

->Ayesha And -> Iman spent their childhood together they were in the same class and that class name was suppose
they are in 10th class 
->Anisha is in class 9th and sana is also class 9th so both in class 9th
->sana and ->anisha in class 9th
so what is anisha class ? 9th
sana class can also be 9th 
anisha will not study alone in class or iman will not study alone in clas 10th there are other kids in class

"so class means In one class there are ayesha and iman ,so can class be multiple of one person ? It can be multipul one
person like suppose iman is in Class 10  and he goes to an tution where he is in class 10A"

iman -"32351" -> class 10th -> class 10A - red

"Suppose there are classes in that tution so there can be more then one classes  one is class 10A And with that  suppose
iman wears red t-shirt So there can be more than one class one is class 10A
AND with that ayesha wears red t-shirt so class means classifying   "
